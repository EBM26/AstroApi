       dislikes: "Pisces, like his symbol, hates being constricted to one place or task; he likes variety and mobility. Pisces dislikes being around people who are mean-spirited, aggressive, shallow, or have little imagination. Pisces dislikes seeing cruelty, hurt, pain, or suffering of any kind.",
       key_words: "Emotion, feelings, compassionate, spiritual, depth, giving, expression, experience, imagination, dreams, adventure, beauty, understanding.",
       romance: "Pisces is a hopeless romantic by nature. Pisces falls in love with the person who can create such a special feeling within him that he cannot get enough of; it doesn’t necessarily have to be the feeling of love. . The Pisces male also looks for a mate who provides him with emotional support and pushes him to accomplish his dreams. The female Pisces is the embodiment of the fair, charming, feminine, damsel in distress. She is quite sought after by many men due to her humble, sweet, accommodating manner; never demanding or pressing her man for much.  All the Pisces woman asks in return is for her man to protect and take care of her."
